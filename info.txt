Hi 
Use the deduper sheet to dedupe 3 columns of data 
Try to only enter email addresses - but the app will try to extract emails from cells appropriately if needed
^This can be used to your advantage -
You can copy entire segments from the admin portal and paste it into the appropriate column
You still need to split the data between column 2 and 3 for users with and without a licence, respectively
ONLY PUT IN NON FORMATED DATA (VALUES ONLY):
this can be accomplished by a hotkey on most systems "CTRL + SHIFT + V"
or you can right click -> Paste special -> values only in google sheets

Designators for which column should accept what data:

Column 1 is designated for USER LIST SUBMITTED BY CUSTOMER
Column 2 is designated for Existing ACTIVE users from any account
Column 3 is designated for Existing INACTIVE users from any acocunt 

You may choose to use it any other way but the data presented might be wrong 
Once your data is in place, press the big red Run Deduper button and your data should be presented in a pop up 
Once you hit the button for the first time the sheet will ask your account for permissions 
So it can run the script in the background - Follow the onscreen instructions to give it permissions
